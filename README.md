This is just a program that reads excels sheets and compiles the data on them. 
My main purpose for this code is to compile excel sheets from different poker games in my group, since
managing people's debts gets harder and harder.

The program works by importing excel sheets via commands fed to the program, and records data from marked columns.
The program writes down names in the Name column and values in the Value column, which allows the program to make
data comparisons.
